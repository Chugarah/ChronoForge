/**
 * CompanyLogos Component
 *
 * @component
 * @description Renders a section displaying company logos in a grid layout.
 * The component uses Framer Motion for animations and Next.js Image component
 * for optimized image loading. Each logo is rendered within a motion.div
 * container for animation capabilities.
 *
 * The component is marked with "use client" directive for client-side rendering
 * and follows BEM naming conventions for CSS classes. It includes proper ARIA
 * labels for accessibility.
 *
 * The logos are configured through companyLogosConfig and each logo item gets
 * a unique ID generated using uuid.
 *
 * @example
 * ```jsx
 * <CompanyLogos />
 * ```
 *
 * @returns {JSX.Element} A section containing animated company logo images
